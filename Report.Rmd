* The range (difference between min and max) is 56 years, from a minimum of 32 to a maximum of 88.

* The average age in the sample is approximately 69 years, with a median slightly higher at 71, suggesting a slight concentration of older individuals.

* The trimmed mean (which removes extreme values) is 69.85, showing that the central tendency is not heavily influenced by outliers.

* The standard deviation of 9.52 and MAD of 7.41 suggest moderate variability. These two values are fairly close, which supports a relatively symmetric distribution.

* The skewness is -1.03, indicating a slight negative (left) skew; more values are concentrated on the higher end of the age scale.

* The kurtosis value near 1 suggests the distribution is relatively flat compared to a normal distribution, indicating less presence of extreme age values.

* The standard error (SE) of 0.53 indicates a precise estimate of the population mean age given the sample size.


## TimeToFirstRecMonths
On average, the time from resection of the primary tumor and first recurrence is about 25 months, but the median is lower (17.28 months), suggesting a right-skewed distribution. This is supported by the positive skewness value (1.11), indicating a longer tail toward higher valuesâ€”some individuals experience much later recurrences. The high standard deviation (21.60) and wide range (1.08 to 113.51 months) show substantial variability. The low kurtosis value (0.55) suggests a flatter distribution, meaning the data is more spread out with fewer outliers than a normal distribution.
