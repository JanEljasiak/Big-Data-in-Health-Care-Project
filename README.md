## Objectives

1. **Descriptive Analysis**  
   - Summarize patient characteristics and clinical variables  
   - Visualize distributions of numerical and categorical data  

2. **Competing Risks Analysis**  
   - Assess the impact of first recurrence treatment on second recurrence and death without recurrence  

3. **Survival Analysis (Cox Models)**  
   - Identify risk factors associated with adverse
